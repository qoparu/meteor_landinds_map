# Meteorite Landings Interactive Map üå†

An interactive global map visualizing meteorite landing sites, built with Python. This project processes data from NASA and generates a feature-rich HTML map using Folium, combining data analytics with a beautiful, custom-styled interface.

It's a perfect example of how to blend creativity with intellect to turn raw data into an engaging story.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Global Map**: Explore thousands of meteorite landings on a sleek, dark-themed map.
- **Dual View Modes**:
    - **Cluster View**: All meteorites are grouped into clusters for a clear overview and great performance. Zoom in to reveal individual glowing markers.
    - **Animated Heatmap**: Switch to a heatmap view with a time slider to visualize the intensity of meteorite falls and finds throughout history.
- **Live Statistics Panel**: A stylish dashboard in the corner displays key metrics: total count, total mass, the largest and oldest recorded meteorites, and a breakdown of "falls" vs. "finds".
- **Custom UI**: The map features custom-styled, animated UI elements for a polished and professional user experience, including a helpful hint to guide users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/qoparu/meteor_landinds_map.git](https://github.com/qoparu/meteor_landinds_map.git)
    cd meteorite-map
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the dataset:**
    Download the `meteorite-landings.csv` dataset from Kaggle (NASA) and place it in the same directory as the `create_map.py` script.

4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python create_map.py
    ```
    This will generate the `meteorite_map_final_with_stats.html` file. Open this file in your web browser to explore the map.
